# SP25 Midterm Lab
In this repository, I made use case diagram of my system AUCTION APPLICATION. Then I created communication diagram of one of the use cases PLACE BID. At last is the code of that use case. Design pattern I used is Observer Pattern.

The code is there. Just copy paste it on Netbeans IDE and make the file name as the main class.java and it will perfectly run!
